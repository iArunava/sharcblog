Got to know why i was rejected from a position after 6months.
Hi Recruiters and Employers :)

If you are spending 2weeks interviewing a candidate. Going back and forth through all the troubles. The candidate is also putting in a lot to make the interviews up-to-the-mark. If you dont expect the candidate to treat you just as another company then dont treat the candidate as just another in the lot, right?

Respect each others time. When you are deciding to not go forward with a candidate just let the candidate know why you are not. What are you scared of? You are already saying a clear no. Why not just give something for the candidates to work on?! Not a big ask. Its right there in the google sheet in front of you :)

I interviewed for a non-tech role. Back in december i think. And was different from the usual tech interviews. So the amount of time that went to prep for that was a lot. Going through different resources, understanding and getting the mindset right for such a role, and more. I remember spending 3days, day and night on a weekend, working on the assignment, to nail it.

And then, on the day of the final interview. My internet connection was messing up. And i was barely able to make what is coming from the other side. At one point, i was just assuming what the was asked and responding. We were barely 10mins into the call. I thought it would stabilize. A pretty short duration to make a call saying i cant do the interview now. Cause there were around 5 executives on the call.

I wasnt expecting to make through. So i was like not a big deal as it was the first time interviewing for that position. They said theyll get back. 3days went by. And then i called. Still then the HR is kept me hanging saying our founders need more time. I called him again and empathized with him so he then revealed that his founders are interviewing other candidates and that i should not expect a call.

Now he never gave me a reason as to what went wrong. My wild guess was the final interview as i was barely able to reciprocate properly in the discussion. Communication is a key in such non-tech roles. tech roles as well. well not so much.

Yesterday, i applied to the same company in a tech role. And i got a call from the HR, the same guy. I told him that i interviewed for the non-tech role like 6months back. He was like, "Oh! Let me see what happened in that interview. Um. Um. Um. Oh it says here, your assignment was not up to the mark."

And then he went on to negotiate my expectation desperately. Story for another day.

Point is. That one feedback is helpful. Now ik its not the lack of experience in non-tech roles. But something went wrong in the assignment. That one feedback. Gives the candidate something to work on right?

Anyhow. Ik. This post is not going to change the way recruiters/employers go about their usual day. But maybe some one HR will change their ways.
