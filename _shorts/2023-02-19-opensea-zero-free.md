Opensea went 0 platform fee!! Their primary source of revenue! Hhahahah!

Feb 18 Opensea tweeted that they are going to decrease their platform fees to 0%. Which was earlier at 2.5% of each transaction! Now doing this has cut down their primary source of revenue. 

They had to make this decision cause of Blur. Blur is another NFT marketplace, that has been gaining quite some attention lately! And so much over the last week that made Opensea take this decision! 

As you can already see, Blur charges 0% platform fees. And thus have been gaining a lot of attention. Last week they launched their own token $BLUR which was airdropped to 100k traders and this has increased interest in the platform as bringing their own token, gives community ownership to everyone and a say to everyone in that community! As you know, web3 is about decentralization, the community needs a voice you cant take that away! 

The more power you give to the community, the stronger your community is :)

Apart from zeroing out their platform fees, they have enforced an optional 0.5% creator royalty and have blacklisted marketplaces that doesnt follw the same policy. Which obviously includes Blur.!

Opensea took the decision of dropping down its fees to zero on Feb 18, thus cutting down its primary source of revenue!!. They tweeted that they are gonna drop the platform fees to zero for a limited time, among other things! Previously they were charging a platform fees of 2.5% for each sale.

This decision was necessary as the competition between, Blur, another NFT marketplace and Opensea heightened. Blur has started getting a lot of traffic, to the point where for the first time since its in launch in October, its trading volume surged pass the trading volume of Opensea on last Wednesday!

Opensea also announced that they are going to enforce an optional 0.5% creator royalty minimum, where sellers can pay more if they want to. A creator royalty is typically x% of cut of the sale price paid to NFT creator.


Opensea and Blur has been at it for a while now. Last Tuesday, Blur released its native token which increases the community ownership of the platform. And thus it gained a lot of traffic, to the point it surpassed the trade volume of Opensea on last Wednesday, for the first time since its launch in last year October!
